# Dependency Fix for Streamlit Cloud Deployment

## üîß Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Streamlit Cloud deployment failed with "No module named 'scipy'" error
**Solution**: Updated requirements.txt to include all necessary dependencies for advanced backtesting features

## ‚úÖ Dependencies Added

The following critical dependencies were added to requirements.txt:

### Core Scientific Computing
- **scipy** - Statistical computations and optimization algorithms
- **numpy** - Numerical computing (already included but ensured)
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning models for portfolio training
- **statsmodels** - Advanced statistical analysis and econometrics

### Data Visualization
- **matplotlib** - Basic plotting and visualization
- **seaborn** - Statistical data visualization

### Data Processing & Export
- **openpyxl** - Excel file reading and writing
- **xlsxwriter** - Enhanced Excel export capabilities
- **python-dateutil** - Date and time utilities

### Market Data
- **polygon-api-client** - Real-time and historical market data

## üß™ Testing Results

All dependencies have been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ scipy imports successfully
- ‚úÖ scikit-learn models work correctly
- ‚úÖ Advanced backtesting modules import without errors
- ‚úÖ Portfolio optimization algorithms function properly
- ‚úÖ Statistical analysis tools available

## üöÄ Deployment Impact

With these dependencies added, Streamlit Cloud will now support:

### Advanced Backtesting Features
- **ML Model Training**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Neural Networks
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, significance tests
- **Portfolio Optimization**: 6 optimization methods including Modern Portfolio Theory
- **Risk Analysis**: VaR calculations, correlation analysis, stress testing

### Enhanced Functionality
- **Data Export**: Excel files with comprehensive results
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Statistical plots and performance charts
- **Market Data Integration**: Real-time data from Polygon.io
- **Scientific Computing**: Numerical optimization and statistical computations

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Deployment Timeline

1. **Automatic Redeployment**: 2-5 minutes after push
2. **Dependency Installation**: 3-7 minutes (scipy compilation)
3. **App Startup**: 1-2 minutes
4. **Total Time**: 6-14 minutes for full deployment

## üéØ Verification Steps

After deployment completes:
1. **Check Navigation**: All 8 sections should be available
2. **Test Advanced Features**: Advanced Backtesting & Training page should load
3. **Verify Imports**: No more "No module named 'scipy'" errors
4. **Test Functionality**: Portfolio optimization and ML training should work

## üìû Support

If issues persist after dependency fix:
- Check Streamlit Cloud build logs for compilation errors
- Verify all environment variables are properly configured
- Contact Streamlit Cloud support for platform-specific issues
